# TrebuchetSort - Erik Johnson, EkriirkE
 Alphabetically sort items in Trebuchet app folders

Run as root (in termux).

cellX and cellY parameters seem to be ignored in folders despite being set properly 
by Trebuchet (no arbitrary/floating icon placements), and rank is the true sort order.  
But why not just do it right, right?
